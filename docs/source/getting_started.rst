Overview
--------

In order to make your data accessible, searchable and assessable you should submit as much metadata as possible to the 4DN system along with the raw files you have generated in your experiments.

These pages are designed to


* show you how to find out what kind of metadata we collect for your particular type of experiment
* introduce the mechanisms by which you can submit your metadata and data to the 4DN data portal.

For an overview of the metadata structure and relationships between different items please see `the slides </help/user-guide/data-organization#metadata-structure>`_ available on the `metadata introductory page </help/user-guide/data-organization>`_.

We have three primary ways that you can submit data to the 4DN data portal.

Web Submission
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The online web submission forms are best used


* To submit one or a few experiments.
* To edit one or a few fields of an already submitted but not yet released item.
* As a hands on way to gain familiarity with the 4DN data model.

Documentation on how to get started with this interface is `here </help/submitter-guide/web-submission>`_.

Data Submission via Spreadsheet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The excel metadata workbooks


* Are useful for submitting metadata and data for several experiments or biosamples
* Can be used to make bulk edits of submitted but not yet released metadata
* Contain multiple sheets where each sheet corresponds to an object type and each column a field of metadata
* Can be generated using the Submit4DN software
* Are used as input to the Submit4DN software which validates submissions and pushes the content of the forms to our database.

Documentation of the data submission process using these forms can be found
`here </help/submitter-guide/spreadsheet>`_.

REST API
^^^^^^^^

For both meta/data submission and retrival, you can also access our database directly via the REST-API.


* Data objects exchanged with the server conform to the standard JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.
* Our implementation is analagous to the one developed
  by the `ENCODE DCC <https://www.encodeproject.org/help/rest-api/>`_.

If you would like to directly interact with the REST API for data submission see the documentation `here </help/user-guide/rest-api>`_.

Notes on Experiments and Replicate Sets
---------------------------------------

**Biological replicates**


* The 4DN Consortium strongly encourages that experiments be performed using at least two different preparations of the same source biomaterial - i.e. bioreplicates.  
* When submitting metadata you should submit two Experiments that use the same Biosource, but have different Biosamples.
* In many cases the only difference between Biosamples may be the dates at which the cell culture or tissue was harvested.  
* The experimental techniques and parameters will be shared by all experiments of the same bioreplicate set.

**Technical replicates**


* Multiple sequencing runs performed at different times using a library prepared from the same Biosample and the same methods up until the sample is sent to the sequencer - i.e. technical replicates.

**Submitting replicate information**


* 
  The replicate information is stored and represented as a set of experiments that includes labels indicating the replicate type and replicate number of each experiment in the set.

* 
  The mechanism that you use to submit your metadata will dictate the type of item that you will associate replicate information with


  * 
    In excel workbooks bioreplicate and technical replicate numbers are entered in the Experiment sheet

  * 
    Using the API you directly associate the replicate information (\ *i.e. replicate number and the experiment identifier*\ ) with the  ExperimentSetReplicate objects.

  * 
    Using the web submission interface the replicate numbers and linked experiments are added from the ExperimentSetReplicate page


* 
  In the database the information will always end up directly associated with ExperimentSetReplicate objects.  

* 
  Specific details on formatting information regarding replicates is given in the `Spreadsheet Submission </help/submitter-guide/spreadsheet#experimental-replicate-information>`_ page.  

* 
  When submitting using the REST API you should format your json according to the specifications in the schema as described in the `REST API page </help/user-guide/rest-api>`_.

Referencing existing objects
----------------------------

Using aliases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Aliases** are a convenient way for you to refer to other items that you are submitting or have submitted in the past.


* An alias is a lab specific identifier that you can assign to any item
* An alias takes the form of *lab:id_string* eg. ``parklab:myalias``.
* An alias must be unique within all items.
* Generally it is good practice to assign an alias to any item that you submit
* If you use the Online Submission Interface to create new items designating an alias is the first required step.  
* Once you submit an alias for an Item then that alias can be used as an identifier for that Item in the current submission as well as in any subsequent submission.

Other ways to reference existing items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You don't need to use an alias if you are referencing an item that already exists in the database.  

Any of the following can be used to reference an existing item in an excel sheet or when using the REST-API.


* **accession** - Objects of some types (eg. Files, Experiments, Biosamples, Biosources, Individuals...) are *accessioned*\ , e.g. 4DNEX4723419.
* **uuid** - Every item in our database is assigned a “uuid” upon its creation, e.g. “44d3cdd1-a842-408e-9a60-7afadca11575”.
* **type/id** in a few cases object specific identifying terms are also available, eg. award number for awards, or lab name for labs. (see table below)

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Object
     - Field
     - type/ID
     - ID
   * - Lab
     - name
     - /labs/peter-park-lab/
     - peter-park-lab
   * - Award
     - number
     - /awards/ODO1234567-01/
     - ODO1234567-01
   * - User
     - email
     - /users/test@test.com/
     - test@test.com
   * - Vendor
     - name
     - /vendors/fermentas/
     - fermentas
   * - Enzyme
     - name
     - /enzymes/HindIII/
     - HindIII
   * - Construct
     - name
     - /constructs/GFP-H1B/
     - GFP-H1B


:raw-html-m2r:`<br>`


* Many of the objects that you may need for your submissions may already exist on the 4DN web site.
* We encourage submitters to use existing database items as much as possible.
* Common reusable items include:

  * Vendors
  * Enzymes
  * Biosources
  * Protocols

* For example, if there is an existing biosource (e.g. accession 4DNSRV3SKQ8M for H1-hESC (Tier 1) ) for the new biosample you are creating, you should reference the existing one instead of creating a new one.

Getting Added as a 4DN User or Submitter
----------------------------------------

Before you can view protected lab or project data or submit data to the 4DN system you must be a registered user of the site and have the appropriate access credentials.


* To view lab data that is still in the review phase you must be registered as a member of the lab that produced the data.  
* To submit metadata and files you must be designated as a submitter for a lab
* Most current 4DN lab members should already be registered in our system.

For instructions on creating an account, please see `this page </help/user-guide/account-creation>`_.

**Metadata and data accessibility.**


* 
  Most metadata items have the following default permissions:


  * members of the submitting lab can view
  * submitters for the lab can edit
  * to help you review and edit a lab's submissions the DCIC data wranglers can view and edit

* 
  Once the data and metadata are complete and quality controlled, they will be released according to the data release policy adopted by the 4DN network.

* After release the data can no longer be edited by data submitters - contact the DCIC to report data issues and we can work together to get them resolved

Getting Connection Keys for the 4DN-DCIC servers
------------------------------------------------

If you have been designated as a submitter for the project and plan to use either our spreadsheet-based submission system or the REST-API an access key and a secret key are required to establish a connection to the 4DN database and to fetch, upload (post), or change (patch) data. Please follow these steps to get your keys.


#. Log in to the 4DN `website <https://data.4dnucleome.org>`_ with your username (email) and password. If you have not yet created an account, see `this page </help/user-guide/account-creation>`_ for instructions.
#. Once logged in, go to your ”Profile” page by clicking **Account** on the upper right side of the page.  
#. In your profile page, click the green “Add Access Key” button, and copy the “access key ID” and “secret access key” values from the pop-up page. *Note that once the pop-up page disappears you will not be able to see the secret access key value.* However, if you forget or lose your secret key you can always delete and add new access keys from your profile page at any time.
#. Create a file to store this information.  

   * The default parameters used by the submission software is to look for a file named "keypairs.json" in your home directory.
   * However you can specify your own filename and file location as parameters to the software (see below).  
   * The key information is stored in json format and is used to establish a secure connection.
   * the json must be formatted as shown below - replace key and secret with your new “Access Key ID” and “Secret Access Key”.  
   * You can use the same key and secret to use the 4DN `REST-API </help/user-guide/rest-api>`_.

**Sample content for keypairs.json**

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "default": {
       "key": "ABCDEFG",
       "secret": "abcdefabcd1ab",
       "server": "https://data.4dnucleome.org/"
     }
   }

**Tip:** If you don’t want to use that filename or keep the file in your home directory you can use:


* the ``--keyfile`` parameter as an argument to any of the scripts to provide the path to your keypairs file.
* 
  the ``--key`` parameter to indicate a stored key name.

    ``import_data --keyfile Path/name_of_file.json --key NotDefault``
