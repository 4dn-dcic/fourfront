## Overview

The 4DN Data Portal will be the primary access point to the omics and imaging data, analysis tools, and integrative models
generated and utilized by the 4DN Network.
As of September 2016, **the portal is currently only open to beta-testers within the network for data submission** for
Hi-C and Hi-C-variant experiments.  Further developments in the metadata models and portal front-end are under way. The portal will be made accessible to the 4DN Network and scientific community at large over the next months.

If you would like submit data to the portal, please contact
[the data wranglers](mailto:4DN.DCIC.support@hms-dbmi.atlassian.net) to get data submitter accounts.
Also, please skim through the [metadata structure](#metadata-structure) and check out the other pages in the **Help** menu for detailed information on the submission process.
We can set up a webex call to discuss the details and the most convenient approach for your existing system.

## Metadata Structure

The DCIC, with input from different 4DN Network Working groups, has defined a metadata structure to describe biological
samples, experimental methods, data files, analysis steps, and other pertinent data.
The framework for the the metadata structure is based on the work of
[ENCODE DCC](https://www.encodeproject.org/help/getting-started/#organization).

The metadata is organized as objects that are related with each other.
An overview of the major objects is provided in the following slides.
