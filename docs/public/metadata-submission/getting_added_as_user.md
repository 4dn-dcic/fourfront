Before you can submit data to the 4DN system you must be a registered user of the site and have the appropriate access credentials. You must be designated as a submitter for the lab for which you want to submit files and metadata. To get set up with an account with the correct access contact the data wranglers at <support@4dnucleome.org>. To validate your credentials, please also cc your PI. We can also create user accounts for lab members who will not submit data but will be able to view submitted data.


**A note on metadata and data accessibility.**
 For most metadata items the default permission will be that the data will only be viewable by the members of the submitting lab and will only be editable by users who have been designated as submitters for that lab. The metadata will also be accessible to data wranglers who can help you review the data and alert you to any issues as the submission is ongoing. Once the data and metadata are complete and quality controlled, they will be released according to the data release policy adopted by the 4DN network.


**A note on the test deployment:** We are deploying the 4DN Data Portal at <https://data.4dnucleome.org>. But at the moment, please use the test portal accessible at <https://testportal.4dnucleome.org>. Data submitted to the test portal may be deleted when server redeployments are necessary; however the forms you prepare can be used for submission to our production portal later.
