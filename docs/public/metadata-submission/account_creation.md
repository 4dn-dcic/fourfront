If you are a lab submitter or new to the project, please email data wranglers at [support@4dnucleome.org](mailto:support@4dnucleome.org) to get set up with an account with the correct access. Please provide an email which you wish to use for your account and cc your PI for validation purposes. **The email associated with the account you use for login must be the same as the one registered with the 4DN-DCIC.** This can be any email address (_e.g. an institutional email account_) but must be connected to either a Google or Github account. For more information on linking your institutional email account to a Google account, see below.


**Using an institutional email account with Google**


The DCIC uses the [Oauth](https://oauth.net/) authentication system which will allow you to login with a Google or Github login. Thus, to register a non-Google account, you should link your institutional email address to a new Google account. To do this, visit the [Google account creation page](https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail) and fill out the form using your non-Google email address.


Once your account request is processed, you will then be able to log in with the 'LOG IN WITH GOOGLE' option using your institutional email address and Google account password.
