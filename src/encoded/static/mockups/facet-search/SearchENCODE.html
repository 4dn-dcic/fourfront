We propose to establish a high throughput production facility to identify the DNA binding sites for transcription factors and chromatin modifying proteins in human cells. Transcription factor targets, chromatin modifications and modifying enzymes will be mapped across the genome using chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. This binding information will be validated and analyzed to ensure that it is of high quality and then compared to other genomic annotations. Our three aims are: 1) To establish a production facility for mapping targets of transcription factors.

Fundamental to understanding human biology and disease is the ability to identify and locate the functional elements in the human genome sequence. Both the effective presentation of experimental data and the ability to analyze sequence data using computational methods will help elucidate genomic function. Because the UCSC Genome Browser serves both of these purposes, it offers the ideal platform for ENCODE data.", "end_date": "2012-1231", "pi_first_name": "W James", "url": "http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=8332919", "award_end_date": null, "award_start_date": null, "number": "U41HG004568", "project": "ENCODE2", "award_number": null, "start_date": "2007-0928", "test": "test", "award_url": null, "pi_last_name": "Kent", "@id": "/awards/1a4d6443-8e29-4b4a-99dd-f93e72d42418/", "@type": ["award", "item"], "name": "THE UCSC ENCODE DATA COORDINATION CENTER"}, "project": "ENCODE2", "target_gene_name": "CTBP2", "geneid_dbxref_list": 1488, "is_current": true, "lab": {"award_number_list": ["U41HG004568"], "fax": "Unknown", "institute_name": "University of California at Santa Cruz", "name": "Jim Kent, UCSC", "city": "Santa Cruz", "phone2": null, "address1": "Baskin School of Engineering", "address2": "1156 High St.; Mail Stop CBSE/ITI", "phone1": "831-459-1401", "award_uuids": ["1a4d6443-8e29-4b4a-99dd-f93e72d42418"], "url": null, "state": "CA", "postal_code": "95064", "institute_label": "UCSC", "test": "test", "awards": ["/awards/1a4d6443-8e29-4b4a-99dd-f93e72d42418"], "pi_name": null, "country": "USA", "@id": "/labs/fb0af3d0-3a4c-4e96-b67a-f273fe527b04/", "@type": ["lab", "item"], "lab_name": null}, "organism_uuid": "7745b647-ff15-4ff3-9ced-b897d4e2983c", "submitter": {"lab_uuids": ["fb0af3d0-3a4c-4e96-b67a-f273fe527b04", "cfb789b8-46f3-4d59-a2b3-adc39e7df93a"], "fax": "Unknown", "last_name": "Kent", "phone2": "Unknown", "google_chat": "Unknown", "phone1": "831-459-1401", "first_name": "Jim", "@type": ["user", "item"], "labs": ["/labs/fb0af3d0-3a4c-4e96-b67a-f273fe527b04", "/labs/cfb789b8-46f3-4d59-a2b3-adc39e7df93a"], "lab_name_list": ["Jim Kent, UCSC", "Michael Cherry, Stanford"], "skype": "Unknown", "test": "test", "timezone": "UTC-8", "@id": "/users/746eef27-d857-4b38-a469-cac93fb02164/", "email": "kent@soe.ucsc.edu", "job_title": "PI"}, "ensembl_dbxref": "ENSG00000175029", "target_class": "Unknown", "submitter_uuid": "746eef27-d857-4b38-a469-cac93fb02164", "organism": {"scientific_name": "Homo sapiens", "taxon_id": 9606, "organism_name": "human", "@id": "/organisms/7745b647-ff15-4ff3-9ced-b897d4e2983c/", "@type": ["organism", "item"]}, "@type": ["target", "item"], "dbxref": {"geneid": ["1488"], "uniprot": ["P56545"], "hgnc": ["ribeye"]}}}], "experiments": [{"files": [], "lab_uuid": "dfc72c8c-d45c-4acd-979b-49fc93cf3c62", "is_obsolete": false, "date_submitted": "2013-05-02", "award_uuid": "90be62e4-0757-4097-b5cf-2e6a20240a6f", "replicates": [{"platform_uuid": "03a96eaf-75da-44e2-b4f6-e349e8c3655e", "biological_replicate_number": 2, "biosample_accession (sanity)": "ENCBS086RNA", "biosample (sanity)": "139T", "platform": {"encode2_dbxref_list": "Illumina_HiSeq_2000", "gpl_ids": ["GPL11154", "GPL13112"], "description": "Illumina HiSeq 2000", "url": "http://www.illumina.com/documents/products/datasheets/datasheet_hiseq2000.pdf", "obi_dbxref_list": "new term will be requested", "test": "test", "dbxref": {"obi": ["new term will be requested"], "geo": ["GPL11154", "GPL13112"], "encode2": ["Illumina_HiSeq_2000"]}, "@id": "/platforms/03a96eaf-75da-44e2-b4f6-e349e8c3655e/", "@type": ["platform", "item"]}, "assay_type (obi)": "OBI_0001864", "@id": "/replicates/c8606394-9b18-4fbf-9a9c-d2b109d71c01/", "technical_replicate_number": 1, "library": {"document_uuids": [], "lab_uuid": "dfc72c8c-d45c-4acd-979b-49fc93cf3c62", "nucleic_acid_type": "RNA", "strand_specificity": true, "@id": "/libraries/4f1b2c43-3769-4fb4-ebf0-911b0ae7fdbe/", "size_range": "&gt; 200", "date_submitted": "2013-05-02", "accession": "ENCLB294ZZZ", "submitter_uuid": "0abbd494-b852-433c-b360-93996f679dae", "award_uuid": "90be62e4-0757-4097-b5cf-2e6a20240a6f", "nucleic_acid_type_so": "SO:0000356", "documents": [], "biosample": {"accession": "ENCBS086RNA", "product_url": "http://www.biochain.com/index.php/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?catalog_number=R1244108-10", "donor_uuid": "f6277156-eb8e-473d-95eb-761ab6860793", "biosample_description": "Human fetal whole eye", "starting_amount": "Unknown", "lot_id": "B608426", "culture_harvest_date": "N/A", "related_biosample_uuid": "", "documents": [{"lab_uuid": "dfc72c8c-d45c-4acd-979b-49fc93cf3c62", "document_type": "data sheet", "document": {"download": "B608426.pdf", "href": "@@download/document/B608426.pdf", "type": "application/pdf"}, "description": "BioChain Human fetal whole eye B608426 data sheet", "award_uuid": "90be62e4-0757-4097-b5cf-2e6a20240a6f", "award": {"award_name": null, "description": "The overall goal of this project is to generate fine-structure RNA maps in human and mouse (C57BL/6NJ) tissues and primary cell lines using a variety of high-throughput sequencing platforms, to evaluate the biological importance of novel transcripts by determining if evidence of their translated products can be identified.

The UCSC browser is a robust, flexible platform that integrates a variety of features that make accessing genomic data both convenient and information-rich. As such, it has attained a high level of acceptance throughout the biology, bioinformatics, and biomedical research communities. During the pilot phase of the ENCODE project, involving 1% of the genome, UCSC has been the repository of sequence-based data. Through participation in the pilot phase, we have established cost-effective, high-throughput approaches for incorporating and displaying ENCODE data, and we have developed an effective interface to the consortium for uploading data files and methods documentation to our FTP site. Through ongoing expansion and improvement of our ENCODE browser, we have laid the groundwork for data management in the whole-genome phase of the project. UCSC's specific aims for participation as the ENCODE DCC are as follows: 1) coordinate closely with the ENCODE data providers to collect, store, and manage ENCODE sequence-based functional element data and related metadata; 2) provide and maintain a long-term storage system for data from the ENCODE Consortium and related genomic projects; 3) provide the ENCODE and public research communities with freely-available mechanisms to access, search, and analyze the ENCODE data; 4) employ good software engineering practices to ensure that the ENCODE data are of the highest possible quality; and 5) foster collaboration with the biomedical community. Fundamental to understanding human biology and disease is the ability to identify and locate the functional elements in the human genome sequence. Both the effective presentation of experimental data and the ability to analyze sequence data using computational methods will help elucidate genomic function. Because the UCSC Genome Browser serves both of these purposes, it offers the ideal platform for ENCODE data.", "end_date": "2012-1231", "pi_first_name": "W James", "url": "http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=8332919", "award_end_date": null, "award_start_date": null, "number": "U41HG004568", "project": "ENCODE2", "award_number": null, "start_date": "2007-0928", "test": "test", "award_url": null, "pi_last_name": "Kent", "@id": "/awards/1a4d6443-8e29-4b4a-99dd-f93e72d42418/", "@type": ["award", "item"], "name": "THE UCSC ENCODE DATA COORDINATION CENTER"}, "target_gene_name": "CTBP2", "is_current": true, "lab": {"award_number_list": ["U41HG004568"], "fax": "Unknown", "institute_name": "University of California at Santa Cruz", "name": "Jim Kent, UCSC", "city": "Santa Cruz", "phone2": null, "address1": "Baskin School of Engineering", "address2": "1156 High St.; Mail Stop CBSE/ITI", "phone1": "831-459-1401", "award_uuids": ["1a4d6443-8e29-4b4a-99dd-f93e72d42418"], "url": null, "state": "CA", "postal_code": "95064", "institute_label": "UCSC", "test": "test", "awards": ["/awards/1a4d6443-8e29-4b4a-99dd-f93e72d42418"], "pi_name": null, "country": "USA", "@id": "/labs/fb0af3d0-3a4c-4e96-b67a-f273fe527b04/", "@type": ["lab", "item"], "lab_name": null}, "organism_uuid": "7745b647-ff15-4ff3-9ced-b897d4e2983c", "ensembl_dbxref": "ENSG00000175029", "target_class": "Unknown", "submitter_uuid": "746eef27-d857-4b38-a469-cac93fb02164", "@id": "/targets/0369858d-7f87-42c4-84ff-7a352e825ffa/", "dbxref": {"geneid": ["1488"], "uniprot": ["P56545"], "hgnc": ["ribeye"]}, "target_label": "CTBP2", "project": "ENCODE2", "geneid_dbxref_list": 1488, "submitter": {"lab_uuids": ["fb0af3d0-3a4c-4e96-b67a-f273fe527b04", "cfb789b8-46f3-4d59-a2b3-adc39e7df93a"], "fax": "Unknown", "last_name": "Kent", "phone2": "Unknown", "google_chat": "Unknown", "phone1": "831-459-1401", "first_name": "Jim", "@type": ["user", "item"], "labs": ["/labs/fb0af3d0-3a4c-4e96-b67a-f273fe527b04", "/labs/cfb789b8-46f3-4d59-a2b3-adc39e7df93a"], "lab_name_list": ["Jim Kent, UCSC", "Michael Cherry, Stanford"], "skype": "Unknown", "test": "test", "timezone": "UTC-8", "@id": "/users/746eef27-d857-4b38-a469-cac93fb02164/", "email": "kent@soe.ucsc.edu", "job_title": "PI"}, "date_created": "2012-09-30", "hgnc_dbxref_list": "ribeye", "organism": {"scientific_name": "Homo sapiens", "taxon_id": 9606, "organism_name": "human", "@id": "/organisms/7745b647-ff15-4ff3-9ced-b897d4e2983c/", "@type": ["organism", "item"]}, "@type": ["target", "item"]}]}, "@id": "/search/", "@type": ["search"]}</script>
