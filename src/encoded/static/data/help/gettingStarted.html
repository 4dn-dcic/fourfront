The 4DN Data Portal will be the primary access point to the omics and imaging data, analysis tools, and integrative models 
generated and utilized by the 4DN Network. 
As of September 2016, <b>the portal is currently only open to beta-testers within the network for data submission</b> for 
Hi-C and Hi-C-variant experiments. 
Further developments in the metadata models and portal front-end are under way. 
The portal will be made accessible to the 4DN Network and scientific community at large over the next months.<br>
<br>

If you would like submit data to the portal, please contact 
<a href="mailto:4DN.DCIC.support@hms-dbmi.atlassian.net" target="_blank">the data wranglers</a> to get data submitter accounts. 
Also, please skim through the <a href="#metadata-structure">metadata structure</a> and 
<a href="#data-submission">data submission</a> sections below. 
We also have a <a href="#rest-api">RESTful API</a> that can be utilized for data submission. 
We can set up a webex call to discuss the details and the most convenient approach for your existing system.
