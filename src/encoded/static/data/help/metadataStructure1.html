The DCIC, with input from different 4DN Network Working groups, has defined a metadata structure to describe biological 
samples, experimental methods, data files, analysis steps, and other pertinent data. 
The framework for the the metadata structure is based on the work of 
<a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/help/getting-started/#organization" target="_blank">ENCODE DCC</a>.<br>
<br>

The metadata is organized as objects that are related with each other. 
An overview of the major objects is provided in the following slides.
