We provide data submission forms as excel workbooks that are flattened versions of the metadata schemas, but only
containing fields that actually can/should be submitted.
We also provide software tools that handle the interaction with our REST API to generate these forms and push the
content of the forms to our database.
Documentation of the data submission process using these forms can be found
<a href="http://localhost:8000/help/submitting">here</a>.
