For both meta/data submission and retrival, you can also access our database directly via the REST-API. 
Data objects exchanged with the server conform to the standard JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. 
Documentation on the REST API will be available soon. Our implementation is practically the same as the one developed 
by the <a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/help/rest-api/">ENCODE DCC</a>. 
Please contact us if you would like to directly interact with the REST API instead of the excel workbooks for data 
submission and we can guide you.
