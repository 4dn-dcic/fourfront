The 4D Nucleome Network aims to understand the principles behind the three-dimensional organization of the nucleus in
space and time (the 4th dimension) and the role nuclear organization plays in gene expression and cellular function.
The Network will utilize existing omics and imaging technologies as well as develop new ones to generate data and create
resources to enable the study of the 4D Nucleome. 
More information about the 4D Nucleome program can be obtained at the <a href="http://www.4dnucleome.org/">4DN portal</a>
and the <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/4Dnucleome/index">NIH program</a> website, which also lists the
<a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/4Dnucleome/FundedResearch">funded research centers</a>.<br>
<br>

The 4DN Data Portal will be the primary access point to the omics and imaging data, analysis tools, and integrative models
generated and utilized by the 4DN Network. As of September 2016, <b>the portal is currently only open to beta-testers 
within the network for data submission</b> for Hi-C and Hi-C-variant experiments. 
Further developments in the metadata models and portal front-end are under way. 
The portal will be made accessible to the 4DN Network and scientific community at large over the next months.<br>

Please note that the data currently publicly accessible at the portal are from prior published work and are included for 
testing purposes. 

Please refer to the original publications and GEO accessions if you use these data.
