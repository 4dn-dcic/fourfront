The 4DN Data Portal will be the primary access point to the omics and imaging data, analysis tools, and integrative models
generated and utilized by the 4DN Network. As of September 2016, <b>the portal is currently only open to beta-testers 
within the network for data submission</b> for Hi-C and Hi-C-variant experiments. 
Further developments in the metadata models and portal front-end are under way. 
The portal will be made accessible to the 4DN Network and scientific community at large over the next months.
