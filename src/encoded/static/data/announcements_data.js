/*******************
Contains the announcements used in home.js and announcements.js
For each announcement, define a title, author, data, and content. All should
be strings. Author and date are optional but will change the announcement subtitle
if omitted.
Please note, you must embed html objects (such as links) within the content manually
This can be done like so: <a href=\"YOUR PATH HERE\">YOUR TEXT HERE</a>
Escaping the in quotations with \ in the <a> tags is crucial. Please note that
html elements can ONLY be embedded in the content section.
