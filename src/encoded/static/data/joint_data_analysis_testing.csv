The generated data will consist of X,Y(t) vectors of length ~1000, sampled on second to minute timescales. For each experiment, we will also be sampling a ""simple"" housekeeping locus (info soon), so for each cell there will be multiple data vectors (e.g. 2 each MUC4 and Simple). OPEN QUESTION - use of Rho/ROCK inhibitor in ""Standard H1"" protocol- we would prefer not use inhibitor since it interfers with cell dynamics.
