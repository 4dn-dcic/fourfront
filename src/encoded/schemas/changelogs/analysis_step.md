* *output_file_types* and *input_file_types* were updated to have more accurate terms:

        "mapping": {
            'minus strand signal of multi-mapped reads': 'minus strand signal of all reads',
            'plus strand signal of multi-mapped reads': 'plus strand signal of all reads',
            'signal of multi-mapped reads': 'signal of all reads',
            'normalized signal of multi-mapped reads': 'normalized signal of all reads'
        }
