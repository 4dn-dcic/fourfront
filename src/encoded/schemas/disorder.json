Please note that you need to contact OMIM in order to reuse these annotations in other software products. Other codes include PCS for published clinical study. This should be used for information extracted from articles in the medical literature. Generally, annotations of this type will include the PubMed id of the published study in the DB_Reference field. ICE can be used for annotations based on individual clinical experience. This may be appropriate for disorders with a limited amount of published data. This must be accompanied by an entry in the DB:Reference field denoting the individual or center performing the annotation together with an identifier. For instance, GH:007 might be used to refer to the seventh such annotation made by a specialist from Gotham Hospital (assuming the prefix GH has been registered with the HPO). Finally we have TAS, which stands for “traceable author statement”, usually reviews or disease entries (e.g. OMIM) that only refers to the original publication.",
