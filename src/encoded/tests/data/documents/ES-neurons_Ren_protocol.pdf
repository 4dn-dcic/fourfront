For neuronal differentiation, 3 million feeder free mESCs were plated onto nonadherent bacterial dishes in EB medium (ES medium without LIF and only 10% FBS) and incubated for 8 d. Medium was changed every 2 day and 5 uM retinoic acid was added after 4 d. Embryoid bodies were then dissociated and the cells plated on Polyornithine (100  g/ml) and laminin ( 0.5  g/cm2) coated plates at a density of 15 million cells per 10 cm plate. The B27 medium was changed after 1 d. After 2 d, the medium was replaced by BME B27 neuronal medium. The differentiated neurons were characterized by TuJ1 and MAP2 staining and harvested at day 4 after plating.
