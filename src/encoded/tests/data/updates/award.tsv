In this project, we focus on the transcriptional regulation of alternative first exons in a tissue specific manner. First exons are often poorly characterized in eukaryotic genomes. Furthermore, alternative first exons can reside in genomic locations that are far apart from each other, leading to distinct usage of proximal promoters. There are numerous examples in the literature on widely separated alternative promoters that are responsible for tissue specific expression. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that alternative splicing of first exons is indicative of alternative proximal promoter usage, which will be an important factor in our identification of functional cis-element clusters that regulate differential tissue-specific gene expressions. The project tightly couples the computational expertise in Weng's laboratory with the extremely sensitive and quantitative gene expression technique recently developed by Ding and Cantor at Boston University. We will computationally characterize all genes in the 30 Mb of human sequence selected by the ENCODE project, identify ~ 100 genes with alternative first exon splicing, study the expression levels of splicing variants in major tissue types, and investigate the cis-elements in the promoters of these genes that could account for their transcriptional regulation. The project has four specific aims: 1) Computationally analyze the ENCODE sequences and select ~100 genes that exhibit both alternative first exon usage and tissue specific expression patterns; 2) Experimentally validate first exon usage for all genes identified in Aim 1 and measure their expression levels in ten major tissue types; 3) Computationally predict cis-element clusters in the alternative proximal promoters of the genes and select ~40 most confident predictions that may account for tissue-specific expressions; and 4) Experimentally test the ~40 computational predictions using transfection assays in five cell lines.

First, gene transcription needs to be accurately regulated and defects in gene regulation can result in human diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Second, chromosomes need to be replicated and then accurately and reliably transmitted to daughter cells. Chromosome segregation requires extensive chromosome compaction. Defects in this process can lead to genome instability, aneuploidy and cancer. Recent studies have revealed that the spatial organization of chromosomes is a major factor in controlling both gene expression and chromosome segregation. The work proposed here will for the first time characterize the three-dimensional (3D) arrangement of chromosomes during different stages of the cell cycle at unprecedented resolution which will allow the identification of cis-elements involved in the 3D folding of chromosomes. A set of novel and powerful genomic technologies (5C and Hi-C) that allow the mapping of 3D chromosome folding will be applied to the study of the human genome. These technologies will be combined with the use of synchronous cell populations and genome-wide analysis of regulatory elements to characterize the different chromosome conformations during the cell cycle and to identify the cis-elements and some trans-factors involved. In addition, the processes that determine 3D folding of the genome, such as transcription and modulation of DNA topology will be studied. This project will provide answers to long-standing questions related to long-range gene regulation, chromosome segregation, the epigenetic transmission of transcription profiles to daughter cells, and the still largely mysterious process of formation of compact metaphase chromosomes.

To address this question a structural map of the 30 Mb of the ENCODE regions of human genomic DNA, at single-nucleotide resolution, has been produced, based on hydroxyl radical cleavage patterns of DNA. A freely available database, ORChID (OH Radical Cleavage Intensity Database), was constructed to house hydroxyl radical cleavage data. An algorithm was developed to predict the hydroxyl radical cleavage pattern of any DNA sequence to high accuracy. This algorithm was applied to the ENCODE regions of the human genome, and the resulting data were deposited in the UCSC genome browser. This dataset of DNA structural data can be searched for structural patterns in genomic DNA that may be associated with biological function. The first objective of this project is to develop high-throughput methods for collecting hydroxyl radical cleavage data, to enhance the predictive power of the ORChID database. The second objective is to locate structural features in human genomic DNA that are under selective evolutionary pressure, but for which the exact nucleotide sequence is not under selection. Experimental data production and informatics pipelines, data verification and validation protocols, and plans for data deposition are detailed in the application.	ENCODE2	ENCODE

While many aspects of annotation are difficult, it is particularly challenging to determine which parts of a genome sequence encode proteins, and therefore how the processes leading to protein translation are regulated. Not only are technologies for examining proteins more limited than those for studying RNA transcription, in an extensive study of transcription by the Encyclopedia of DNA elements consortium, a picture of great complexity emerged. The project uncovered many novel exons, alternative splice forms, and novel regulatory elements. These results indicate that nearly 9/10ths of human genes undergo alternative splicing, and the average gene produces approximately 6 splice variants. Rather than solidify knowledge regarding the location and function of genes, these results question whether we accurately know what constitutes a gene, and how the products encoded by genes determine the function of cells. The results particularly obfuscate determination of which transcripts are selected for translation to protein, further complicating annotation efforts. To address that gap, our project will determine which transcripts encode proteins, and how these are affected in several tissue types and disease conditions. We will use large tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data sets, mapping the analyzed protein data directly to several available human genome sequences, along with sets of predicted transcripts produced by the N-SCAN and CONTRAST gene finders, to reveal which parts of transcripts are translated into proteins, and in which types of cells this translation occurs. To accomplish this, our project has three specific aims: 1) to develop high-accuracy methods and software for mapping proteomic data from mass spec analyzed proteins directly to the genome locus encoding them; 2) to develop an analysis pipeline software system using a novel rule-based information management approach; and 3) to apply these developments for the high-throughput analysis of large proteomic data sets, identifying the transcripts that encode proteins in distinct tissue types and disease conditions, and placing the results in a publicly accessible track in the UCSC genome browser. We believe this project will yield significant knowledge about the location and timing of protein translation in cells, which will potentiate further investigation of how misregulation of the path from transcription to translation leads to human disease conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sequencing of the human genome is complete, but figuring out where genes are located, how they function, and how they cause or prevent human diseases like cancer has only just begun. Genes act as blueprints for RNA and proteins, the workhorses of the cell. We are developing technologies to address the key challenges of determining which genes specify the building of which proteins and how this process is orchestrated to ultimately unravel how disease processes occur.

Previous large-scale efforts have produced an excellent catalog of transcriptional start sites for most mammalian genes but the mechanisms that control the activation of each promoter in specific cell types remains largely Unknown. To better understand the regulatory mechanisms of tissue- and cell type-specific gene expression, it is important to characterize the activities of each promoter in specific cell types, and identify the cis-regulatory elements including enhancers and insulators for each gene. Here, we propose to use the laboratory mouse as a model system and conduct genome-wide analysis of active promoters, enhancers and insulator elements in a panel of embryonic and adult tissues with medical relevance. Specifically, we will (1) identify the active promoters in the mouse genome in a representative set of embryonic and adult tissues; (2) identify potential enhancers and insulator elements in the mouse genome in the same embryonic and adult tissues; (3) identify and characterize tissue-specific promoters and enhancers in the mouse genome; and (4) validate the function of a select set of identified promoters and enhancers. The proposed study, if completed, will result in a comprehensive map of promoters, potential enhancers and insulators throughout the mouse genome. The resource will provide a foundation for analyzing the gene regulatory networks in the mouse cells, and guide the functional annotation of the mouse genome. The results will also help understand the evolution of cis-regulatory sequences, when compared to similar results to be made available as the human ENCODE project progresses. The laboratory mouse represents an important model system for understanding human biology and the molecular basis of human diseases. As a reference to the human genome, the mouse genome sequence has proved extremely valuable in gene annotation. The utility of the laboratory mouse as a model system is currently limited by the lack of understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms that control both common and species-specific gene expression programs in mouse cells. In this project, we propose to define the set of genomic sequences known as cis-regulatory elements in the mouse genome. These regulatory DNA consists of promoters, enhancers, insulators and other regulatory sequences. As a key step towards understanding the gene regulatory mechanisms in mammalian cells, we will produce a comprehensive map of promoters, enhancers and insulators in the mouse genome. We will use a newly developed, high throughput experimental strategy to identify these sequences that are engaged in gene activation in the mouse embryonic stem cells, embryonic fibroblasts, and a panel of embryonic and adult tissues. We will identify tissue specific promoters and enhancers, and characterize the regulatory mechanisms that control the gene expression programs in the specific tissues. Completion of the proposed research is expected to improve our knowledge of the gene regulatory mechanisms in mammalian cells, and provide a reference for understanding the same process in human beings.

Our comparative approach aims to uncover principles and solve problems that are proving difficult by studying the human genome alone. ENCODE is vigorously mapping hundreds of function-associated biochemical markers in selected cell lines, resulting already in tens of millions of reproducible biochemical features. Some observed protein:DNA interactions find and refine known transcriptional enhancers, promoters, silencers, together with associated chromatin structure, as was anticipated. But substantial questions arise as to how many of the myriad biochemical events are functional, what those functions are, which gene or genes are meaningful targets, etc. To highlight and sort functionally important biochemical marks from others, we will systematically identify the molecular events retained by both mouse and human since they diverged. We will then analyze how conservation of biochemical features relates to conservation of DNA sequence and conservation of regulated gene expression. By using the mouse, we can leverage decades of molecular genetics and manipulated mouse genomes that do not exist in any other mammal. In Aim 1 we execute genome-wide assays for biochemical signatures of functional DNA sequences in a few specific mouse cell types. By using well-studied mouse lines and cell states, we can interpret results in light of previously validated elements and in light of ENCODE human results. We will use ENCODE standards for high throughput, sequence-based assays to determine gene expression, DNase hypersensitive sites, histone modifications and selected transcription factor occupancy in seven mouse cell types. The eight selected features are the most informative ones for function, and thus most useful for comparison with human data. In Aim 2, we apply a genome-wide implementation of chromosome conformation capture to map the interactions between transcription factor binding sites and their responsive genes in two cell types. These results will be compared to those from an ENCODE developmental project. Comparative analysis in Aim 3 will insure that the impact of the data we produce will go beyond the individual mouse cell systems per se. To do this we have organized a collaboration of investigators at multiple institutions, in which each group is expert in one or more critical aspects. Our data, made public and accessible via ENCODE, will fuel and accelerate many future studies after the 2-yr stimulus both in and beyond ENCODE. This responds to NHGRI request for applications on ""Enhancement of the value of the human ENCODE Project by conducting a parallel effort on the mouse genome."" The proposed work will improve the maps of biologically functional DNA sequences in humans, which in turn will help explain how variants in human genome sequences could be associated with human diseases, leading to candidates for novel avenues for effective therapy and prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every person differs in his or her response to pathogens and in the likelihood that they will suffer from complex diseases such as cancer, heart disease or diabetes. Individual susceptibility to disease is determined in part by genetics, and we can map with high precision the locations of DNA variants associated with disease susceptibility. In order to understand how these variants contribute to disease susceptibility, we need to identify the biological functions of all DNA sequences; the proposed work will help us map these functional DNA sequences."

The ENCODE project has focused its initial attention on two cell lines, 1) K562 cells, a myeloid precursor cell line and 2) GM12878, a lymphoblastoid cell line, and our laboratory has mapped the binding sites of a large number of transcription factor expressed in these cells. To study their conservation and help provide functional information into these binding sites and to determine if these sites are occupied in vivo, we propose two types of studies. First, we will map the binding sites of at least 30 transcription factor orthologs that have been analyzed in the human ENCODE project in mouse MEL and CH12 cells which are analogous to K562 and GM12878 cells, respectively. Second, we will map the binding sites of Pol II and nine other factors in cells differentiated from human CD34+ cells and primary erythroid mouse cells. These studies will determine which transcription factor binding sites and gene targets are conserved in vertebrates and which are species-specific as well as determine the extent to which targets mapped in cultured cell lines reflect in vivo binding sites. The information from these studies will be deposited into public databases and is expected to be extremely valuable to the large mouse and human genetic communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ENCODE project has produced relatively large amounts of data on transcription factor binding and RNA expression in a limited number of human cell lines. We propose to extend these results by obtaining mouse cell lines at similar states of differentiation to human cell lines. We will then duplicate the experiments that have been done in human cells, and locate control elements based on sequence conservation and similarities in factor binding between the two species. We will also determine if elements identified in vitro are occupied in cells isolated from organisms.	ENCODE2-Mouse	ENCODE

Digital DNaseI technology enables efficient genome-wide mapping of accessible chromatin and DNaseI hypersensitive sites. The core regions of DNaseI hypersensitive sites are constitutively populated by regulatory factor binding sites, the nucleotide-resolution footprints of which may be systematically exposed on a genome-wide scale by ultra-deep sequencing. DNaseI hypersensitive sites exhibit marked cell-type variability; accordingly, production of a comprehensive catalog will require surveying a wide range of cell types. Cell types targeted under this proposal include murine analogues of the ENCODE Tier 1 and Tier 2 common reference cell lines; a broad spectrum of primary adult tissues; embryonic stem cells; and sentinel tissues amenable to sequential temporal profiling during development. The production of a parallel, high-quality, high-resolution compendium of mouse regulatory DNA will greatly enhance the value of the human ENCODE project and will provide a rich independent and unique resource for evolutionary, functional, and model organism genomics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance to Public Health Understanding the genetic basis of human disease requires detailed knowledge of the functional elements of the human genome which may be subject to polymorphism. The ENCODE Project seeks to identify all of the functional elements in the human genome, and present project seeks to greatly increase the value of the ENCODE data by providing a parallel catalogue of regulatory DNA in the mouse genome. This project is therefore expected to provide key insights into the importance of elements in the human genome, and to provide an unprecedented resource for rational functional modeling of human disease in the mouse.

Our group, consisting of scientists at UCSF, UC Davis, UCSC and the British Columbia Genome Sciences Centre has the broad expertise that this project requires. We will focus on cells relevant to human health and complex disease including cells from the blood, brain, breast and U.S. Government-approved lines of human embryonic stem cells (aim 1). We will incorporate high quality, homogeneous cells from males and females, and two predominant racial groups, and biological replicates of each cell type. Production of comprehensive maps will include 6 histone modifications selected for their opposing roles in regulating active and inactive chromatin (aim 2), DNA methylation (aim 3) and miRNA and gene expression (aim 4). This epigenetic data, along with genetic and expression data will be integrated using advanced informatics (aim 5) to address fundamental roles of epigenetics in differentiation, maintenance of cell-type identity and gene expression. Our cell and data production pipeline will incorporate verification and data validation with independent methods, and will operate under a model motivated by increased data production and decrease cost. We summarize the analysis capacity of our instruments and our explicit strategy for data sharing of our proposed REMC-generated resources including biological specimens, protocols, data, software tools and intellectual resources. We envision that our group in conjunction with the other REMC teams, the EDACC, ENCODE, future EHHD (Epigenetics of Human Health and Disease) centers and the NIH Roadmap program will develop methods, tools and reference epigenome maps for the research community that will make the promise of epigenetics in understand and treating human complex disease a reality. Our reference epigenomes will enable new disciplines including human population epigenetics, comparative epigenomics, neuroepigenetics, and therapeutic epigenetics for tissue regeneration and reversal of disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epigenome is the dynamic interface between our changing environment and the static genome, and understanding it is a goal of immense importance to human health. We will map reference cell epigenomes of the brain, breast, blood and approved embryonic stem cells, inclusive of males and females and different racial groups. This cooperative work will transform our understanding of the short and long-lasting consequences of environment impact on human health and disease.	ENCODE2	ENCODE

In pursuit of this goal, we have assembled a unique scientific team and infrastructure with broad expertise and capabilities in stem cell biology, epigenomics, technology, production research and computation. We recently demonstrated two complementary methods that leverage ultra high-throughput sequencing for epigenomic analysis. In the first method, genome-wide chromatin maps are acquired by deep sequencing chromatin IP DNA (ChlP-Seq). In the second, nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps are generated by high-throughput bisulfite-sequencing (HTBS). These methods represent major improvements over prior tools as they yield precise digital information, have high genome coverage, require fewer cells and are cost-effective. Multiple epigenomic maps have already been produced for stem cells and primary tissues, and pipelines have been assembled for efficient data collection, processing and analysis. For the REMC project, we propose to apply ChlP-Seq and HTBS pipelines to generate comprehensive high-resolution maps of chromatin state and DNA methylation for 100 diverse cell types. Cell types were selected for their biological and medical importance, and for their potential to maximize the comprehensiveness of acquired epigenomic data. They include human ES cells, ES-derived cells, mesenchymal stem cells, reprogrammed stem cells and primary tissues. ChlP-Seq will be used to map highly informative chromatin modifications and related chromatin proteins in each cell type. HTBS will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps. Reference epigenomes will reveal the locations and activation states of diverse functional genomic elements, inform on the developmental state and potential of studied cell populations, and provide a framework for understanding complex epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. All data will be made available to the scientific community upon verification. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Comprehensive characterization of epigenetic marks ('the epigenome') is a critical step towards a global understanding of the human genome in health and disease. The proposed mapping studies will provide unprecedented views of the human epigenetic landscape and its variation across cell states, offer fundamental insight into the functions and interrelationships of epigenetic marks, and provide a framework for future studies of normal and diseased epigenomes.

The Northwest Reference Epigenome Mapping Center aggregates leading experts in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) biology, lineage-specific differentiation of hESCs, and well-established differentiating and differentiated adult primary tissue systems to establish a substantial capacity for the production of purified cells and tissues for large-scale epigenomic studies. The Center integrates this capacity with an existing high-throughput genomics and informatics infrastructure operating at scale, creating unique synergies that enable genome-scale epigenetic analyses of high-value human primary and progenitor cell types. The Center will perform high-resolution, whole-genome profiling of foundational epigenotypes in project cell types including high-resolution quantification of chromatin structural remodeling, and analysis of DNA methylation at both actively remodeled and silenced regulatory DNA templates. The Center will also profile both small RNA species and conventional gene expression from all study cell types. The Center's informatics and analytical arm will manage project data and its release into consortium and public repositories, and will perform integrative analyses to elucidate the connection between major epigenotypes and dynamic cellular programming of gene expression.

In addition, these cells could be potentially used as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. Differentiation of hESCs involves selective activation or silencing of genes, a process controlled in part by the epigenetic state of the cell. In order to gain a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating differentiation of hESCs, and produce general reference epigenome maps of the human cells, we propose to establish an Epigenome Center in San Diego. Our center will be focused on both undifferentiated hESC and four hESC-derived early embryonic cell lineages including extraembryonic endoderm, trophoblast, mesendoderm (a common precursor to mesodermal and endodermal lineages), and mesenchymal cells (a specific mesoderm derivative). We have developed and validated high throughput technologies for mapping the state of DNA methylation and chromatin modifications throughout the genome, and will use these methods to generate high-resolution maps of the reference epigenomes. Specifically, we will grow and differentiate hESCs into multiple lineages, and map DNA methylation sites using a newly developed technology that combines bisulfite conversion and whole genome shotgun sequencing. We will also determine the histone modification status in the genome by performing both ChlP-chip and ChlP-Seq analysis. We will develop advanced statistical and algorithmic solutions to facilitate high-throughput sequencing data analysis, and establish an informatics pipeline for collecting, storage, and distribution of epigenome maps. Finally, we will perform integrated data analysis to identify new epigenetic patterns in the genome that could provide insights in mechanisms of epigenetic regulation.	ENCODE2	ENCODE

Transcription of RNA is one of the functional processes which permit the transfer of encoded information from the DNA sequence into function. Recent evidence suggests that the catalogue of transcripts that are made for the human genome is more complex than indicated by current annotations. The locations and characteristics of regulatory elements encoded in the genome which control the expression of these transcripts are even less well understood. The goal of this proposal is to describe a collection of generic and unbiased strategies which can be used, on a genome-wide scale, to locate the sites of transcription and the functional elements which regulate RNA expression. These strategies have high density oligonucleotide arrays and chromatin immunoprecipation (CHIP) as core technologies that will enable the mapping of these sites. For the first year of our proposed ENCODE project, 30 Mb of distributed genomic sequence (approximately 1% of genome) selected from 44 different chromosomal locations ranging in size from 500 kb to 2 Mb will serve as target sequences. A single array with approximately 810,000 probe pairs that interrogate the 30 Mb of sequence at every 37 bp, on average, will be synthesized and used as a common platform to map the locations of both transcription and functional regulatory elements. The functional elements which will be monitored are the binding sites for 15 transcription factors and 4 repressors as well as the locations for 7 types of histone modifications which have been correlated with RNA regulation. Three well-characterized phorbol ester or retinoic acid- responsive cell lines (Jurkat, NCCIT and HL-60) will be temporally monitored when activated by these molecules and will provide the biological context for these studies. To demonstrate the scalability of this collection of strategies, the second and third years of our proposed studies will be focused on constructing a similar collection of maps, at a resolution of 35 bp on average, but across the entire human genome.

First we will produce a quantitative chromatin profile of the ENCODE regions in a human lymphoblastoid cell line. This profile will enable precise localization of all major Dnasel-hypersensitive sites ('HSs' hereafter). Quantification of sequence-specific Dnasel sensitivity will be accomplished through application of a novel, tested high-throughput quantitative real-time PCR assay ('Hypersensitivity qPCR' or 'HSqPCR'). A specialized primer set that spans the ENCODE regions at high resolution will be designed and synthesized. This primer set will be employed in all the experiments. Second, we will produce quantitative chromatin profiles of the ENCODE regions in 3 additional cell types derived from the 3 major embryonic lineages (endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm). These profiles will enable localization of all major HSs present in each tissue type. The profiles, in combination with that of lymphoid cells, will further enable identification of tissue or lineage-restricted HSs and also of sites present in multiple lineages. Third, we will perform confirmatory validation experiments on identified HSs using high-resolution hypersensitivity Southerns. Hypersensitivity Southerns represent an extensively applied 'gold-standard' methodology for identification of HSs. 250 sites per year will be selected from those identified with the high throughput method and validated with this independent methodology. Fourth, the quantitative chromatin profiles produced will be subjected to detailed computational analysis with the aim of determining the correspondence between HSs and evolutionarily-conserved non-coding sequences. Parallel analyses will focus on identification of DNA sequence motifs associated with tissue-specific, lineage-specific, or multilineage HSs. Algorithms for identification and classification of HSs in the human genome will be developed and tested. The performance of selected published algorithms for identification of active regulatory sequences will also be evaluated. It is expected that this research effort will result in the identification of the majority (if not all) of the regulatory elements of the ENCODE regions, and will provide information on the feasibility of the application of this functional approach to the identification of all regulatory elements of the human genome.

The goal of this project is to computationally predict and experimentally validate DNA sequence motifs that explain promoter function. The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome. These results will also help to identify the proportion of functionally relevant transcription factor binding events. The three aims of our project are: Aim 1: We will use two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) to determine a subset of known transcription factor binding motifs that are the most predictive of promoter activities. Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site. Aim 3: We will then perform mutagenesis of the informative positions within the 900 sites identified in Aim 2, and measure their promoter activities by using transient transfection assays. We also plan to test 100 lower ranking sites to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our algorithms. We will also develop an oligo competition assay as a new approach to increase the throughput of experimental motif analysis for the rest of the genome. The data generated in this project will be the first systematic functional analysis of TF binding sites at base-pair resolution.	ENCODE2	ENCODE

Eukaryotic organisms depend on the actions of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) for successful post-transcriptional control gene expression and they provide the link between transcriptional and translational regulation, playing essential roles in many regulatory processes including transcription, splicing, export, stability and translation. The comprehensive identification of cis-regulatory elements residing in expressed RNA is fundamental to the NIH/NHGRI ENCODE project but is extremely limited at the present time. Previously we developed methods for purifying endogenous RBP-RNA complexes and identifying the associated RNA targets using whole genome expression array technologies (termed ribonomics). This advance enabled the large-scale identification of many mRNA targets of RBPs and provided new insight into the principles governing posttranscriptional gene regulation. Our studies demonstrated that, analogous to transcriptional regulation, groups of functionally related RNAs are coordinately regulated in a combinatorial manner by distinct classes of RBPs by targeting related cis-regulatory elements located in the transcripts. As part of an earlier ENCODE technology grant, we improved our technology by developing a RIP-Chip tiling-array based assay that incorporates a digestion step to facilitate the identification of targeted cis-regulatory elements/RBPbinding sites. Using this method, the objective of this project is to comprehensively catalog the cis regulatory elements/RBP-binding sites CREBS present in expressed ENCODE mRNA using the five ENCODE cell lines and several cellular perturbations. This will be accomplished by (1) characterizing the genome-wide associations of expressed mRNA with a set of representative set of RBPs using ribonomic profiling and whole-genome expression arrays; (2) identifying the CREBS of the subset of ENCODE expressed mRNAs using tiling-array based RIP-Chip; (3) verifying and further increasing the resolution of predicted ENCODE cis-regulatory elements/RBP-binding sites using bioinformatics followed by quantitative Real-Time PCR and (4) biologically validating the function and RBP-binding activity of identified CREBS using a reporter assay. ln summary, we will use RNA-binding proteins to identify RNA based cis-regulatory elements / RBP-binding sites in the ENCODE sequence of the human genome.

The ENCODE project is a large multi center project which aims to define all the functional elements in the human genome. This will be achieved using many different experimental techniques coupled with numerous computational techniques. A critical part in delivering this set of functional elements is the integration of data from multiple sources. The ED AC proposal aims to provide this integration. As proscribed by the RFA for this proposal, the precise prioritization for the EDAC's work will be set by an external group, the Analysis Working Group (AWG). Based on previous experience, these analysis methods will require a variety of techniques. We expect to have to apply sophisticated statistical models to the integration of the data, in particular mitigating the problems of the extensive heterogeneity and correlation of variables on the human genome. We have statistical experts who can use the large size of the human genome, coupled with a limited number of sensible assumptions to produce statistical techniques which are robust to this considerable heterogeneity. We also expect to apply machine learning techniques to build integration methods combining datasets. These included Bayesian based inference methods and the robust computer science technique of Support Vector Machines. Each of these methods have performed well in the ENCODE pilot project and we expect them to be even more useful in the full ENCODE project. We will also provide quality assurance and summary metrics of genome-wide multiple alignments. This area has a number of complex statistical, algorithmic and engineering issues, which we will solve using state of the art techniques. Overall we aim to provide deep integration of the ENCODE data, under the direction of the AWG and in tight collaboration with the other members of the ENCODE consortium.	ENCODE2	ENCODE

The UCSC browser is a robust, flexible platform that integrates a variety of features that make accessing genomic data both convenient and information-rich. As such, it has attained a high level of acceptance throughout the biology, bioinformatics, and biomedical research communities. During the pilot phase of the ENCODE project, involving 1% of the genome, UCSC has been the repository of sequence-based data. Through participation in the pilot phase, we have established cost-effective, high-throughput approaches for incorporating and displaying ENCODE data, and we have developed an effective interface to the consortium for uploading data files and methods documentation to our FTP site. Through ongoing expansion and improvement of our ENCODE browser, we have laid the groundwork for data management in the whole-genome phase of the project. UCSC's specific aims for participation as the ENCODE DCC are as follows: 1) coordinate closely with the ENCODE data providers to collect, store, and manage ENCODE sequence-based functional element data and related metadata; 2) provide and maintain a long-term storage system for data from the ENCODE Consortium and related genomic projects; 3) provide the ENCODE and public research communities with freely-available mechanisms to access, search, and analyze the ENCODE data; 4) employ good software engineering practices to ensure that the ENCODE data are of the highest possible quality; and 5) foster collaboration with the biomedical community. Fundamental to understanding human biology and disease is the ability to identify and locate the functional elements in the human genome sequence. Both the effective presentation of experimental data and the ability to analyze sequence data using computational methods will help elucidate genomic function. Because the UCSC Genome Browser serves both of these purposes, it offers the ideal platform for ENCODE data.	ENCODE2	ENCODE

The ENCODE Consortium brings together laboratories that generate complex data types via experimental assays with laboratories that integrate these unique data using computational analyses to discover how chromosomal elements function together to define the human cell. The DCC's participation enhances the data created by these laboratories through the creation of structured pipelines for the verification and validation of all submitted data and providing processes for the documentation of metadata that describe each biological sample and assay method. To facilitate access to all the data created by the previous ENCODE projects as well as data from the modENCODE project and any other large data collections that are determined to be appropriate for incorporation, the DCC will construct a state of the art data storage repository called the Big Data Hub. The DCC will design and development new software to enhance the data submission and processing pipeline, the organization and access to metadata and the Big Data Hub. In addition, we will create the ENCODE Portal that will be the primary entry point to the wealth of experimentally determined information as well as results of computational analyses. The Portal will integrate these data resources and make them available via enhanced search and browsing capabilities. Tools will be implemented to aid discovery by both experienced bioinformaticians and naive laboratory staff. The DCC will evolve into a substantial service organization allowing biomedical research to take full advance of the ENCODE results. To this end the DCC will provide documentation via many media including written documentation, video tutorials, webinars, and meeting presentations. The DCC, DAC, and AWG will be tightly woven together to create the EDCAC. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of this work for public health is that the comprehensive determination of functional elements encoded by the human genome is essential for understanding the nature of human health and the treatment of disease.

This proposal aims to create the ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC, or the DAC), consisting of a multi-disciplinary group of leading scientists who will respond to directions from the Analysis Working Group (AWG) of ENCODE and thus integrate data generated by all groups in the ENCODE Consortium in an unbiased manner. These analyses will substantially augment the value of the ENCODE data by integrating diverse data types. The DAC members are leaders in their respective fields of bioinformatics, computational machine learning, algorithm development, and statistical theory and application to genomic data (Zhiping Weng, Manolis Kellis, Mark Gerstein, Mark Daly, Roderic Guigo, Shirley Liu, Rafael Irizarry, and William Noble). They have a strong track record of delivering collaborative analysis in the context of the ENCODE and modENCODE Projects, in which this group of researchers was responsible for the much of the analyses and the majority of the figures and tables in the ENCODE and modENCODE papers. The proposed DAC will pursue goals summarized as the following seven aims: Aim 1. To work with the AWG to define and prioritize integrative analyses of ENCODE data; Aim 2.To provide shared computational guidelines and infrastructure for data processing, common analysis tasks, and data exchange; Aim 3. To facilitate and carry out data integration for element-specific analyses; Aim 4.To facilitate and carry out exploratory data analyses across elements; Aim 5.To facilitate and carry out comparative analyses across human, mouse, fly, and worm; Aim 6.To facilitate integration with the genome-wide association studies community and disease datasets; and Aim 7.To facilitate writing Consortium papers and assist evaluating ENCODE data. RELEVANCE: The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project is a coordinated effort to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a comprehensive catalog of functional elements in the human genome. This proposal establishes a data analysis center to support, facilitate, and enhance integrative analyses of the ENCODE Consortium, with the ultimate goal of facilitating the scientific and medical communities in interpreting this human genome and using it to understand human biology and improve human health.

This includes identifying all the protein-coding loci with associated alternative variants, non-coding loci which have transcript evidence available in the public nucleotide database (NCBI/EMBL/DDBJ) and pseudogenes. To achieve this goal we will integrate computational approaches, including recent comparative methods, expert manual annotation, able to integrate literature information, and targeted experimental approaches. Based on the exhaustive experimental and computation investigation of our initial GENCODE annotation of the ENCODE regions we are confident that we can deliver a gene set with high specificity and sensitivity that will provide critical information to other biologists and other ENCODE groups. As part of this process we will label all apparent gene loci clearly, classifying them according to their likely current functional status, so users are informed where regions that appear gene like are most likely pseudogenes or where transcript evidence is most likely artefactual. There are a number of motivated groups working in the area of defining protein coding genes for the human genome. This proposal includes most such groups and coordinates with other key groups. Critically, all the groups bring extensive experience of data integration and evaluation, leading to the resolution of annotation discrepancies by multiple approaches. This gives us confidence that through this integrated project we will be able to eliminate many of the remaining uncertainties about the precise location of genes and their component exons and transcript structure in the human genome. Genome-wide, highly accurate transcript definition will be of enormous value to the myriad of researchers working on the human genome. It will both have large cost savings worldwide due to increased specificity of reagent design and provide a more complete view of human genes, in particular those associated with disease. From this foundation, more accurate descriptions of the genetic causes of disease can be discovered.	ENCODE2	ENCODE

Based on the empirically determined characteristics of the detected transcripts uncovered in this proposal, a classification system for transcribed protein coding and non-protein coding portions of the human transcriptome will be established. Our aims include first to generate a comprehensive set of subcellular compartment-specific long (>200 nucleotides, nts) and short (<200 nts) polyadenylated (polyA+) and non-polyadenylated (polyA-) RNA samples from each of the cell types studied. These RNA samples will be analyzed using: a) high density tiling arrays (5 nucleotides [nt] interrogation resolution for long and short RNAs), b) sequencing (pyrosequencing [454] and clonal single molecule sequencing for short RNAs [Solexa]), c) sequenced paired-end ditags (PETs) for 5' TSS and 3' termination locations for polyA+ transcripts and d) sequenced cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) tags for 5' TSS of polyA- RNAs. Characterization of full length subcellular compartment-specific transcripts will also be carried out using: 1) a combination of rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), RT-PCR and sequencing, 2) RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and 3) in situ immunohistochemistry. These characterization steps will provide additional information concerning the annotated and unannotated RNAs found to be associated with known functional, compartment-specific proteins and their localization in subcellular organelles of known function. The research and health-care community are well positioned to take advantage of a detailed catalog of classified transcribed regions in the human genome. For example, the identification of millions of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and the ability to genetically alter specific transcript expression by small inhibitory (si-) and micro (mi-) RNAs are highly useful for the molecular characterization of diseases associated with the transcribed regions. However, the utility of these and other genomic resources are dependent upon having a complete and high quality catalogue of transcribed regions.	ENCODE2	ENCODE

We propose to establish a high throughput production facility to identify the DNA binding sites for transcription factors and chromatin modifying proteins in human cells. Transcription factor targets, chromatin modifications and modifying enzymes will be mapped across the genome using chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. This binding information will be validated and analyzed to ensure that it is of high quality and then compared to other genomic annotations. Our three aims are: 1) To establish a production facility for mapping targets of transcription factors. The pipeline will consist of five components: a) cell preparation, b) antibody validation and chromatin immunoprecipitation, c) DNA target analysis, d) target validation and e) sample tracking and databases. 2) To use the pipeline to map targets of 600 transcription factors, chromatin modifications and chromatin modifying enzymes in at least two major cell lines (HeLa S3 and HepG2), and targets of other factors in additional cell lines. 3) To maintain our results in a database and also make them accessible through public databases. We will interrelate our genomic annotations with those determined by other groups (particularly those from the ENCODE consortium), focusing on correlating patterns of transcription-factor binding and chromatin modifications with gene expression. We expect this project to contribute significant information to the identification of regulatory and functional elements in the human genome.	ENCODE2	ENCODE

We will accomplish this goal by identifying regions of open chromatin with two independent and complementary methods: DNasel hypersensitivity and Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE), combined with single-nucleosome mapping and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for selected regulatory factors. The immediate benefit of success will be a high-quality public atlas of the human DNA regulatory elements that are likely to be active in each cell type. Identification of open chromatin regions has been one of the most accurate and robust methods to identify functional promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and locus control regions in mammalian cells. A principal advantage of an open chromatin approach is that all potential sites in the genome are simultaneously assayed in an unbiased manner. DNasel hypersensitivity and FAIRE interrogate chromatin by entirely different underlying mechanisms, and therefore represent independent, cross-validating assessments of chromatin state. In addition, we will perform single-nucleosome mapping in selected cell types as an independent direct biochemical verification of open chromatin regions. For a selected subset of cell-types, we will further annotate open chromatin regions with respect to their biological activity by determining the binding location of proteins that mark transcription start sites, transcriptional units, insulators, or have broad regulatory function. The Aims of this proposal are 1) to identify all regions of open chromatin in 40 cell types by DNasel and FAIRE analyses, and 2) determine the biological function of open chromatin regions by ChIP and nucleosome mapping. To accomplish these Aims, we have assembled a team of five researchers who are leaders in their respective fields and who have contributed significantly to the ENCODE pilot project. Furthermore, we have developed a streamlined pipeline, which has been used to generate high quality whole-genome data from a number of cell types.	ENCODE2	ENCODE

In this application, we propose to undertake a large-scale project to map the genomewide locations of >35 histone modifications and related proteins in >20 human cell types by coupling chromatin IP with massive-throughput sequencing on the Solexa platform. Our preliminary data demonstrate that this approach is highly accurate and a major advance over existing technologies in terms of cell requirements, genome coverage, throughput and cost-effectiveness. A sequencing pipeline will be applied to generate more than 500 genomewide datasets of chromatin structure by sequencing >1000 samples. A computational pipeline will then convert the sequencing reads into high resolution, genomewide maps that can be visualized in genome browsers and used for downstream analysis. Comparative genomic analysis and motif-finding tools will be applied to classify genomic sites based on associated chromatin structures and to identify underlying sequence determinants. Cell and molecular biology methods will be used to validate inferred functions for a representative subset of discovered elements. Chromatin regulation is extensively implicated in many aspects of human development and disease. In particular, cancer cells may universally exhibit aberrant chromatin states. The proposed systematic identification and characterization of chromatin regulatory elements in the human genome will offer unprecedented insight into the structure and function of chromatin, and provide an invaluable resource for investigators in chromatin, genomics, cancer and many other fields of research. All data collected in the context of the proposed project will be made available pre-publication to the greater scientific community once reliability has been confirmed.	ENCODE2	ENCODE

The pilot ENCODE project sought to develop and test a variety of experimental, computational and analytical platforms to determine the best ways to approach this problem by focusing on a defined 1% of the human genome. During this initial phase of ENCODE, the applicants of this proposal developed robust high-throughput methods for detecting and validating functional transcription promoters, DNA methylation patterns, and transcription factor occupancy in the pilot regions, and demonstrated that these approaches can be scaled fully to the entire human genome with high robustness, sensitivity and specificity. These experiences, together with the resulting technology and analysis platforms and an existing, highly productive infrastructure, lead to this response to NHGRI's RFA-HG-07-030. This application presents an ambitious proposal to expand a program to map and functionally annotate cis-regulatory sequences of the human genome. The plan emphasizes full genome-comprehensivity for three experimental pipelines.: 1) a new sequence-based method called ChlPSeq to elucidate more than 600 comprehensive transcription factor:DNA interactomes; 2) a similar new method called MethSeq to determine the methylation status of all the CpG-rich regions in the human genome in more than 1,000 human cell types and cell states; and 3) a high throughput transfection assay pipeline to measure transcriptional activities of 25,000 human ""promoter-plus"" proximal cis-regulatory domains, including at least one major promoter for each of the annotated protein-coding genes. A second major product of the promoter pipeline will be a physical resource of proximate reporter constructs for all human genes, designed to accommodate future fine-structure dissection of the promoter regulatory motifs and testing of long-distance elements. All of the experimental work in this project will be subjected to analysis with appropriate quality metrics. In addition, comparative genomics and other computational analyses will be integrated with the experimental production to help prioritize and shape input to the pipelines and to capture information in forms useful to both biologists and genomicists. These analyses will produce several large-scale deliverables, including hundreds of ChIP data-driven sequence motif models, some of which additionally leverage evolutionary conservation for each of hundreds of transcription factors."

We plan to map DNaseI hypersensitive sites at physiological resolution across the genome with high sensitivity and specificity. The major focus of our production effort will be on data quality, a strategy that served the Human Genome Project well. Accordingly, samples will be rigorously screened in a pipeline fashion, with only a select set advancing to whole-genome data collection (Specific Aim 1). To ensure the broadest possible coverage of both unique and non-unique genomic territories, a synergistic combination of three technologies (DNase-array, digital mapping of DNAasel cleave site sequences, and Quantitative Chromatin Profiling) will be applied (Specific Aim 2). This combination will enable mapping of >95% of the DHSs in the genome of each cell type. Independent validation provides the ultimate quality standard. We therefore plan to validate the DHS catalogue in a statistically rigorous fashion using hypersensitivity Southerns, a well-established, gold standard assay (Specific Aim 3). Since DNAasel hypersensitive sites are generic markers of a broad spectrum of human cis-regulatory sequences, the utility of the catalogue will be greatly enhanced by the classification of DHSs into major functional categories including promoters, distal elements (enhancers, LCRs), and insulators (Specific Aim 4). Validation of DHS functional classes will be accomplished using well-tested cell and transgenic assays of biological function (Specific Aim 5).	ENCODE2	ENCODE

Comprehensive identification and characterization of functional DNA elements is thus an essential goal with major implications for human health. Genomic DNA is organized into chromatin, a higher-order structure composed of DNA, RNA and proteins. Chromatin mapping technologies have emerged as a powerful means for identifying functional DNA elements, which are associated with characteristic chromatin structures. Mapping has enabled the systematic annotation of diverse types of functional elements, including promoters, enhancers and silencers, and new discoveries related to chromatin organization and genome regulation in health and disease. The proposed ENCODE data production center aims to vastly expand the catalog of functional elements in the human genome through production mapping of Protein, DNA and RNA constituents of chromatin. High-throughput pipelines will be used to map histone modifications, chromatin regulatory proteins and non-coding RNA binding interactions. These pipelines will be applied to designated ENCODE cell lines, embryonic stem (ES) cells and derivatives, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and phenotypically diverse human tissues. Key histone modifications will also be mapped in representative cell and tissue types from multiple individuals, in order to address the extent and significance of inter-individual variation in chromatin landscapes and their relationships to genetic background. These multi-dimensional datasets will be integrated through innovative computational algorithms to identify sequences, motifs, variants and regulatory interactions that dictate chromatin state and functional element activity. Thus, the proposed project will dramatically increase the number, resolution and precision of functional DNA elements in the ENCODE catalog, and explicitly define causal sequences and physical interactions that mediate chromatin states and regulation in the human genome. All data will be rapidly released and made freely available to the scientific community.	ENCODE3	ENCODE

The results obtained from our genome wide mapping experiments will greatly advance the efforts of the ENCODE consortium to comprehensively identify all functional elements in the human genome. Our experimental data will be subjected to stringent quality metrics already established by the consortium and the results made publicly available in a timely manner. Targeted biological validation experiments will be performed, along with integrative analyses.

This pertains in particular to gene regulatory elements, many of which are located far away from their target genes, but play fundamental roles in human biology. Significant progress towards annotation of the gene regulatory architecture has been made in recent years predominantly using cultured human cells. However, large-scale studies in mice, as well as anecdotal examples identified in human studies, have indicated the existence of large populations of gene regulatory sequences with very restricted temporal and tissue-specific activity during mammalian development. Despite their critical importance in human development and disease, this set of regulatory sequences will likely be missed by approaches restricted to cell lines or adult tissues. To fill this gap, the major objective for this U54 application is to generate catalogs of developmentally active gene regulatory sequences using existing high throughput data production pipelines for genomic approaches including ChlP-Seq, MethylC-Seq and RNA-Seq on embryonic tissues. Performing such studies directly on human tissues is not feasible due to limited availability of human embryos at relevant stages of development. We will therefore in this study exploit the laboratory mouse, a widely used animal model that shares a similar embryonic developmental program and gene regulatory architecture with humans. In addition to embryonic development, our studies will also generate a complementary reference dataset from postnatal and adult mice to better understand the dynamics of gene regulation over time. Furthermore, we will assess the biological authenticity of identified regulatory sequences by in-depth functional validation using an established transgenic mouse pipeline. It is anticipated that generation of these datasets will fill a major void in the functional annotation o a mammalian genome and help to complete the catalog of gene regulatory sequences in the human genome.

This means discovering and mapping all parts of all genes, including exons, introns, promoters and cis-regulatory sequences, in previous phases of the ENCODE Project, the applicants of this proposal developed and applied robust, high-throughput, genome-wide methods for determining transcription factor occupancy, assessing DNA methylation, identifying RNA transcripts, and experimentally testing candidate regulatory elements and mutations. The combination of experiences from the previous phases with the resulting technology and analysis platforms and the existing, highly productive infrastructure of the applicants form the basis of this response to NHGRI's RFA-HG-11-024 (""Expanding the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) in the Human and Model Organisms""). This application presents an ambitious proposal to expand the biological dimensions of ENCODE to include essentially all transcription factors for measurements of occupancy and to produce transcriptomes from hundreds of very specific cell types, and even single cells. The specific plan is to: 1) determine genome wide occupancy for all transcription factors and major cofactors with high resolution in two or more cell types; 2) map and quantify all messenger RNA transcripts, microRNAs and other non-ribosomal RNAs in more than 300 well-defined, uncultured cell types; 3) map DNA methylation state genome-wide at nucleotide resolution in more than 300 cell types; and 4) apply a high-throughput transient transfection assay system to test the impact of -2,000 candidate regulatory elements on gene regulation. All experimental work in this project will be evaluated by appropriate quality metrics, and after quality control, all data will be rapidly deposited in publi, freely accessible genome databases. In addition, computational analyses, including evaluation of comparative and population genomics data, will be integrated with the experimental production to help ensure quality and to capture information in forms useful to biologists, genomicists, and medical researchers. Completion of these Specific Aims will enable biomedical researchers to better and more rapidly understand the consequences of mutations in genomic disorders, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and almost ail common diseases and, therefore, to more fully realize the potential of genomics to impact human health."

From each sample analyzed, we propose to isolate long (>200 nucleotides) and short (< 200 nucleotides) RNA in biological duplicate. Illumina-based maps for these samples will initially be generated using (1) RNA sequencing (-seq) of ribosomal (r-)RNA depleted long total RNA. (2) RNA-seq of tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) pre-treated short RNA (3) Pair-end Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (PE-CAGE) of total RNA. Additionally, for a subset of primary cell lines we will generate the above libraries from nuclear and cytoplasmic subcellular fractions. Long RNA-Seq data will be distilled down into functional elements consisting of splice junctions, polyadenylatio sites and de novo genes and transcripts. The short RNA data will be distilled into contigs representing the 5' ends of short RNAs up to the read length. PE-CAGE data will be analyzed to form clusters representing the 5' ends of transcripts linked to a tag internal to the transcript body. Importantly, each element will be assessed for reproducibility using a nonparametric Irreproducible Detection Rate (nplDR) script. Collectively, these data will allow for the detection of novel transcribed regions and supportive information as to the location of promoter regions and subcellular residence of transcripts. In aggregate, these data will be used to generate models of both noncoding and protein coding transcripts and to distinguish isoforms at complex loci necessary to obtain a comprehensive view of mammalian transcriptomes. For a subset of these samples we will simultaneously collect the genome sequence of the human donors to provide a reference map that will be used to map the RNA data against and derive information concerning allele-specific expression and RNA editing. Unannotated transcript models will be tested using long-range (PacBio/454) sequencing. Lastly, proteogenomic analysis will be done and the results compared against the unannotated transcripts.

To do this, we will generate stable HeLa-S3 and GM 12878 cell lines expressing epitope-tagged RBPs and determine the sub cellular localization pattern of each RBP. These cells will be used to perform CLIP-Seq assays to define genome-wide, and at single-nucleotide resolution, the RNA sequence elements recognized by 250 RBPs. The RNA sequence elements identified will be validated using sequence-based in vitro binding assays. Furthermore, ChlP-Seq will be performed for all nuclear localized RBPs to determine the regions of the genome and chromatin that each RBP associates with. These binding assays will be supplemented with functional assays in RBP-depleted cells that will be critical for assigning functions to the identified binding sites. These assays include RNA-Seq of total cellular RNA and RNA purified from various cellular fractions, ribosomal footprint profiling, and Gro-Seq. Together, these assays will provide functional information regarding the roles of each RBP in splicing, cleavage and polyadenylation, RNA stability, RNA editing, translation, RNA localization, and transcription. Bioinformatic analysis will be performed, largely using software generated by our group, to quantitate all assays and to associate functions to the sequence elements identified in the binding assays. Together, these experiments will provide a comprehensive and in depth measure of the functions of approximately half of the human RBPs and the functional sequence elements that they interact with. This project will fill a major gap in the catalog of functional elements encoded in the human genome that are being characterized by the ENCODE consortium. The product of this project will be a unique and valuable community resource that will push the field forward in new and exciting ways and will almost certainly create new paradigms regarding the functions of RBPs and RNA-protein networks in human biology and disease.

Building on the prior success of the UW ENCODE center, we plan to localize DNasel hypersensitive sites, to define the locations of DNasel footprints therein, and to continue to provide relevant synergistic annotations including RNA-seq, histone modifications, and CTCF, as well as DNA methylation. The overriding focus of our production effort has been on data quality. Accordingly, samples will be rigorously screened in a pipeline fashion, with only a select set advancing to whole-genome data collection. To ensure the broadest possible coverage of both unique and non-unique genomic territories, we will employ a higher resolution, higher coverage sequencing strategy than the prior project period, significantly enhancing the information content of the data. This proposal integrates the UW-FHCRC Mouse ENCODE Center, which will be closely aligned with the human project to generate a comparative catalogue of regulatory DNA in carefully matched cells and tissues, providing an unparalleled resource. Since DNasel hypersensitive sites are generic markers of a broad spectrum of human cis-regulatory sequences, the utility of the catalogue will be greatly enhanced by the classification of DHSs into major functional categories including promoters, distal elements (enhancers, LCRs), and insulators. We plan to systematically connect distal DHSs with their cognate promoters and to perform in vivo validation of these connections using nuclease-mediated knockouts of distal DHSs in somatic cells.

The following projects build on my previous work and utilize integrative analyses of genomic datasets to address the genome as a complex regulatory system. Update of research projects on individual functional elements and community impact. Exon Skipping. My work to identify sequence mutations that cause exon skipping (Woolfe et al. 2010) applied statistical tests to determine which features showed statistically significant, predictive ability to discriminate neutral variants from disease-causing mutations. We implemented the results in a web server that evaluates variants of Unknown function to predict those most likely to cause exon skipping, Skippy, (http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/skippy/), which continues to receive the most visits of all NHGRI webservers and downloads for private use. Recent work in my lab, using the Skippy web server to prioritize all known synonymous substitutions in the CFTR gene, identified two uncharacterized variants that cause exon skipping and are likely to contribute to cases of cystic fibrosis (Scott et al. 2012). Recent applications of this software by other groups include the identification and functional characterization of 11 novel PLP1 mutations involved in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease and spastic paraplegia type 2 (Grossi et al. 2011), in prioritization of mutations detected in the COL4A1 gene involved in Walker-Warburg Syndrome in humans (Labelle-Dumais 2011), in evaluation of mutations involved in risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (Bronson et al 2011), and in diseases important to cattle breeding strategies (Gargani et al. 2011). Negative regulatory elements. My group developed the first, systematic expression vector system to experimentally assay negative regulatory elements (Petrykowska et al. 2008). Despite the commonly held hypothesis that negative cis-acting elements are present in the human genome, examples have not been widely defined or characterized. My research to help identify negative elements has broader importance because mutations in these elements would be activating for disease and could play a role in a host of diseases. Annotations of NRE discovered by my group are posted on the UCSC Human Genome Browser test web site (http://genome-test.cse.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?hgsid=2890633&c=chr4&g=wgEncodeNhgriNre). Since inception of the assay, I have provided the vectors as source materials to the community and continue to collaborate with other labs upon request. Furthermore, I have participated in the ENCODE Consortium analysis groups to experimentally assess the functional activity of putative negative regulatory elements predicted in genomic sequences (ENCODE Consortium et al. 2011 and ENCODE Consortium et al. 2012). New promoter elements. With the objective of identifying new regulatory components in promoters, my group examined mutation data in the Ankyrin-1 (ANK-1) promoter of a patient with ankyrin-deficient Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS), and showed that a novel mutation disrupted the binding of the transcription factor TFIID (Yang et al. 2011, LaFlamme et al. 2010). We hypothesized that the underlying sequence represented a novel promoter element used in promoters of additional genes. We examined 17,181 human promoters for the experimentally validated binding site, called the TFIID localization sequence (DLS) and found three times as many promoters containing the DLS motif than TATA motifs. The region of enrichment was localized to a window of 150 bp upstream to 250 bp downstream of the transcription start site in a profile similar but distinct from the TFIIB Recognition Element (BRE). Mutational analyses of DLS sequences in promoters of randomly chosen genes confirmed the functional significance of the DLS, and addition of a DLS to an SP1 site indicated the combination was sufficient to confer basal promoter activity. The results demonstrate that novel promoter elements can be identified on a genome-wide scale through observations of regulatory disruptions that cause human disease. Projects to integrate multiple functional aspects into disease interpretation. Address the evolution of the human genome through the emergence of new human-specific genes regulated by bidirectional promoters. Research from my group previously established the enrichment of bidirectional promoters in vertebrate genomes including human, mouse, rat, and cow (Yang et al, 2008), which indicates evolutionary selection to maintain their presence. Despite the cross-species similarities, we discovered that some bidirectional promoters correspond to positions of unidirectional promoters in other vertebrate species; leading to the hypothesis that species-specific bidirectional promoters greatly and uniquely target the detection of species-specific transcripts in any genome. We confirmed this hypothesis while participating in the Bovine Genome Consortium (Bovine Sequencing Consortium et al. 2009) and identified a spliced, highly expressed, multi-exon (noncoding) transcript regulated by a bidirectional promoter that was exclusive to the bovine lineage (Piontkivska et al. 2009). To find human-specific transcripts, my group identified a set of 1,400 nonconserved, novel noncoding transcripts flanking bidirectional promoters (Gotea et al. 2012, submitted). Once identified, we tested the transcripts for signs of positive selection, as an indicator of beneficial function to the human genome. After integrating computational and experimental data, we found nucleotide substitutions that facilitate the emergence of new exons in those genes. The gene list provides the basis for understanding novel transcripts that are present only in the human genome. Moreover, using this approach, transcripts can be identified that are unique to any species. Data from this project has been submitted for publication. Compare genome-wide methylation patterns in subtypes of ovarian tumors. I am testing the hypothesis that altered DNA methylation in promoter regions can distinguish genes that are relevant to ovarian tumor pathology. Given the sporadic nature of 90% of ovarian cancers, disruption of normal gene regulation is a likely contributor to disease etiology. Methylation patterns at 25,475 unique loci in 43 samples of ovarian, endometrial or metastatic tumors, along with normal fallopian tube and normal endometrium were assessed. Data from this project showed that methylation patterns mirrored histopathological subdivisions of ovarian tumors and discriminated tumor types with finer granularity and greater reproducibility than published gene expression assays (Kolbe at al. 2012). The extensive differences we showed between tumor and normal samples are the first report of a methylator phenotype in ovarian endometrioid tumors, analogous to the methylator phenotype identified in colorectal cancer and glioblastoma. Ongoing studies will be to look for biomarkers for use in diagnostic tests.	ENCODE2	ENCODE

We are continuing to develop and apply new methods for detecting more complex types of evolutionary sequence constraint, such as lineage-specific constrained sequences or weakly constrained sequences, as well as other types of constraint that might not be reflected in the primary nucleotide sequence. Furthermore, we are utilizing inter-species sequence analyses of functional annotations to identify sequence signatures that might confer function; such approaches are particularly useful for detecting short sequences not evolutionarily constrained in orthologous positions across multiple species, but whose relative position to genes and other features is important. The Section is also developing high-throughput methods to experimentally detect and classify functional genomic sequences. This approach utilizes a flow-cytometry-based selection of GFP-reporter constructs harboring candidate enhancer sequences. Preliminary results are promising and have validated that known sequences with enhancer activity can be detected. Scaling this approach to larger regions of the genome will require the use of new-generation sequencing technologies. We have begun to feed into this pipeline various input DNAs, including those selected to be in an active state (so-called FAIRE sites) as well as synthetically generated random sequences. Along these lines, the Section is utilizing a next-generation sequencing technology from Illumina/Solexa. We are working both on the wet-lab side to get the machine working optimally, as well as the informatics side, developing approaches to maximize the amount of high-quality sequence data that can be extracted from the new instrument. We are pursuing a number of applications, including ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, and other ""tag"" based counting experiments, as well as medically-relevant whole genome sequencing projects that can now be pursued at a dramatically reduced cost. This work will not only enable the above-mentioned research projects in my Section, but also many others in the Institute looking to take advantage of this new technology for their own projects. More recently, we have described patterns of gene expression in layers of the brain and improved the specificity of whole-genome analyses."	ENCODE2	ENCODE
