        "description": "DCIC: The goals of the 4D Nucleome (4DN) Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) are to collect, store, curate, display, and analyze data generated in the 4DN Network. We have assembled a team of investigators with a strong track record in analysis of chromatin interaction data, image processing and three-dimensional data visualization, integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic data, data portal development, large-scale computing, and development of secure and flexible cloud technologies. In Aim 1, we will develop efficient submission pipelines for data and metadata from 4DN data production groups. We will define data/metadata requirements and quality metrics in conjunction with the production groups and ensure that high-quality, well- annotated data become available to the wider scientific community in a timely manner. In Aim 2, we will develop a user-friendly data portal for the broad scientific community. This portal will provide an easy-to-navigate interface for accessing raw and intermediate data files, allow for programmatic access via APIs, and will incorporate novel analysis and visualization tools developed by DCIC as well as other Network members. For computing and storage scalability and cost-effectiveness, significant efforts will be devoted to development and deployment of cloud-based technology. We will conduct tutorials and workshops to facilitate the use of 4DN data and tools by external investigators. In Aim 3, we will coordinate and assist in conducting integrative analysis of the multiple data types. These efforts will examine key questions in higher-order chromatin organization using both sequence and image data, and the tools and algorithms developed here will be incorporated into the data portal for use by other investigators. These three aims will ensure that the data generated in 4DN will have maximal impact for the scientific community.",

        "description": "DCIC: The goals of the 4D Nucleome (4DN) Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) are to collect, store, curate, display, and analyze data generated in the 4DN Network. We have assembled a team of investigators, staff scientists, and developers with a strong track record in analysis of chromatin interaction data, image processing, data visualization, integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic data, data portal development, large-scale computing, and development of secure and ﬂexible cloud technologies. In the ﬁrst phase of the 4DN Project, we have developed the 4DN Data Portal as a central resource with tools for data submission, curation, analysis and quality control, visualization, exploration, and download. The portal provides an easy-to-navigate interface for accessing raw and intermediate data ﬁles, allows for programmatic access via APIs, and incorporates novel analysis and visualization tools developed by DCIC as well as other Network members. In the second phase of the 4DN Project, we will continue to support the research activities by the 4DN Network, and to lead the creation of a well curated 4DN data resource for the scientiﬁc community. At the same time, we propose to enhance the utility of the 4DN Scientiﬁc Data and the Data Portal in multiple ways: i. We will create a platform to integrate imaging and sequencing data and support the creating of reference nuclear maps in a common coordinate system; ii. We will provide support for 4DN Projects on Human Health and Disease with customized ontology applications and protected data management; iii. We will develop new cloud platform capabilities to bring user analyses to the 4DN Data Portal, and apply cost-efﬁciency improvements to support increasing data volumes; iv. We will perform regular outreach activities to raise awareness about the data and tools generated by the Network and DCIC. Overall, we will ensure that the data generated in 4DN will have maximal impact for the scientiﬁc community.",
