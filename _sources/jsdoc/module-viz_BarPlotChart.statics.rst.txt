.. _module-viz_BarPlotChart.statics.genChartData:


Static  ``genChartData``
------------------------

Entrypoint for aggregation. 
First, counts up terms per field from experiments for field in supplied 'fields' param array. Count is adjusted depending on if aggregating experiments, experiment_sets, or files.
Secondly, partitions one field as a child of another. If param 'useOnlyPopulatedFields' is false (default), then will use
first field in param 'fields' array as primary field, or X-axis, and second field as secondary field, or bar subdivision.
If 'useOnlyPopulatedFields' is set to true, will find the first field which has multiple terms (== multiple bars) to use as the primary field, and find
second field with multiple terms to use as the secondary field.

.. js:function:: genChartData(experiments, fields[, aggregate][, experimentsOrSets][, useOnlyPopulatedFields])

    
    :param Array experiments: List of experiments which are to be aggregated or counted by their term(s).
    :param Array fields: List of fields containing at least 'field' property (as object-dot-notated string).
    :param string aggregate: What to aggregate. Can be 'experiments', 'experiment_sets', or 'files'.
    :param string experimentsOrSets: Deprecated. Whether chart is fed experiments or experiment_sets.
    :param boolean useOnlyPopulatedFields: If true, will try to only select fields which have multiple terms to visualize.
    :returns Array: - Array of fields, now containing term counts per field. One field (either the first or first populated) will have a childField with partitioned terms.

.. _module-viz_BarPlotChart.statics.countFieldTerm:


Static  ``countFieldTerm``
--------------------------



.. js:function:: countFieldTerm(fieldObj, term[, updateTotal][, countIncrease])

    
    :param Object fieldObj: A field object with present but incomplete 'terms' & 'total'.
    :param string|Array.<string> term: A string or array of strings denoting terms.
    :param boolean updateTotal: Whether to update fieldObj.total property as well.
    :param number countIncrease: Amount to increase count for term by.
    :returns undefined:

.. _module-viz_BarPlotChart.statics.getTermsForFieldsFromExperiment:


Static  ``getTermsForFieldsFromExperiment``
-------------------------------------------



.. js:function:: getTermsForFieldsFromExperiment(fields, exp)

    
    :param Array fields: List of field objects.
    :param Object exp: Experiment to get terms (field values) from to pair with fields.
    :returns Array: Array of pairs containing field key (index 0) and term (index 1)

.. _module-viz_BarPlotChart.statics.genChartBarDims:


Static  ``genChartBarDims``
---------------------------

Return an object containing bar dimensions for first field which has more than 1 possible term, index of field used, and all fields passed originally.

.. js:function:: genChartBarDims(fields, fields.terms, fields.total[, availWidth][, availHeight][, styleOpts][, useOnlyPopulatedFields][, maxValue])

    
    :param Array.<Object> fields: Array of fields (i.e. from props.fields) which contain counts by term and total added through @see BarPlot.genChartData().
    :param Object fields.terms: Object keyed by possible term for field, with value being count of term occurences in [props.]experiments passed to genChartData.
    :param number fields.total: Count of total experiments for which this field is applicable.
    :param number availWidth: Available width, in pixels, for chart.
    :param number availHeight: Available width, in pixels, for chart.
    :param Object styleOpts: Style settings for chart which may contain chart offsets (for axes).
    :param boolean useOnlyPopulatedFields: Determine which fields to show via checking for which fields have multiple terms present.
    :param number maxValue: Maximum y-axis value. Overrides height of bars.
    :returns Object: Object containing bar dimensions for first field which has more than 1 possible term, index of field used, and all fields passed originally.

.. _module-viz_BarPlotChart.statics.barDataToLegendData:


Static  ``barDataToLegendData``
-------------------------------

Deprecated. Convert barData to array of field objects to be consumed by Legend React component.

.. js:function:: barDataToLegendData(barData[, schemas])

    
    :param Object barData: Data representing bars and their subdivisions.
    :param Object schemas: Schemas to get field names from.
    :returns Array: - Fields with terms and colors for those terms.

.. _module-viz_BarPlotChart.statics.getDefaultStyleOpts:


Static  ``getDefaultStyleOpts``
-------------------------------



.. js:function:: getDefaultStyleOpts()

    
    :returns Object: Default style options for chart. Should suffice most of the time.
