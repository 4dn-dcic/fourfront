Description
===========

A Component and utility (via Component's 'statics' property & functions) to 
queue and dequeue alerts from appearing at top of pages. Alerts, once queued, will persist until they are closed by
the end user, which is the same functionality as calling Alerts.deQueue(alert) from anywhere in application, supplying the same
title for alert that was queued.
